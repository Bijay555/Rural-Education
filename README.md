The analyzed information consists of the performance of teachers and the infrastructure related  problems like poor ceiling, washrooms, etc. and any other issues faced in school, This information is sent to related concerned  higher authority where necessary steps have to be taken in stipulated time. Also the portal will have access to all the teacher database to monitor on teachers and their activity.
